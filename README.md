_*Warning* Download and Install at your own **risk**!_

Hello this is my dotfiles repository. I have created this so that I can easily reconfigure my setup on any macOS system. This setup is for those who primarily work on data analysis, cleaning, and modeling, as well as programming. The two main languages I use are Python and R. I also enjoy working quickly and efficiently, so these dotfiles set up some global hotkeys and window managers. 

These dotfiles are not crossplatform compatiable and should only work on macOS systems. **You should never blindly download and install random scripts to your computer** Albiet, you can trust me but before installing check through the scripts and make sure you know what they are doing. Several scripts require you to run sudo.
